installed and able to be run - connected to my contentful backend correctly - 
I got stalled on what signals {preview} which I think toggles the pre-header alert.

Basically, this is a perfect starter. As soon as I get the basic template working, push to github
then deploy master env, or maybe change test to deploy env? prob that - so we are working on dev normally
and then when we want to run QA we push to master, and then when we want to push public go to deploy?
